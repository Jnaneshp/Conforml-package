ConformL: A Comprehensive Framework for Time Series Conformal Prediction
Abstract
ConformL is a novel Python framework designed to provide uncertainty quantification in time series forecasting through conformal prediction methods. The framework integrates multiple forecasting models with distribution-free prediction intervals, offering both theoretical guarantees and practical applicability. This work introduces adaptive conformal prediction techniques specifically tailored for non-stationary time series, alongside traditional cross-validation methods for stationary data. The framework supports various base models including ARIMA, SARIMA, Linear Regression, and LSTM networks, making it versatile for different time series characteristics. Experimental validation on real-world datasets demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in maintaining nominal coverage while providing informative prediction intervals.
Keywords: Time Series, Conformal Prediction, Uncertainty Quantification, Distribution-Free Methods, Adaptive Algorithms

1. Introduction
1.1 Background
Time series forecasting is a fundamental problem in statistics and machine learning with applications spanning finance, meteorology, healthcare, and industrial monitoring. While point predictions are valuable, understanding the uncertainty associated with these predictions is equally crucial for decision-making processes. Traditional approaches to uncertainty quantification often rely on distributional assumptions that may not hold in practice, particularly for complex, non-stationary time series.
Conformal prediction, introduced by Vovk et al. (2005), offers a distribution-free framework for constructing prediction intervals with finite-sample validity guarantees. Unlike traditional methods, conformal prediction provides coverage guarantees without assumptions about the underlying data distribution, making it particularly attractive for time series applications where distributional assumptions are often violated.
1.2 Motivation
Existing time series forecasting libraries primarily focus on point predictions, with limited support for principled uncertainty quantification. When prediction intervals are provided, they often rely on strong distributional assumptions or asymptotic properties that may not hold for finite samples or non-stationary data.
The ConformL framework addresses these limitations by:

Distribution-Free Guarantees: Providing prediction intervals with finite-sample coverage guarantees regardless of the underlying data distribution
Model Agnostic: Supporting multiple base forecasting models within a unified framework
Adaptive Methods: Introducing novel adaptive conformal prediction techniques for non-stationary time series
Practical Implementation: Offering a user-friendly interface for practitioners and researchers

1.3 Contributions
This work makes the following key contributions:

Framework Design: Development of a comprehensive, modular framework for time series conformal prediction
Adaptive Methods: Implementation of adaptive conformal prediction algorithms tailored for non-stationary time series
Model Integration: Seamless integration of diverse forecasting models including classical statistical models and modern neural networks
Empirical Validation: Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrating the framework's effectiveness across different datasets and scenarios
Open Source Implementation: Release of a complete, well-documented Python package for community use


2. Theoretical Foundation
2.1 Conformal Prediction Framework
2.1.1 Basic Setup
Let (X1,Y1),(X2,Y2),…,(Xn,Yn)(X_1, Y_1), (X_2, Y_2), \ldots, (X_n, Y_n)
(X1​,Y1​),(X2​,Y2​),…,(Xn​,Yn​) be a sequence of training examples, and let (Xn+1,Yn+1)(X_{n+1}, Y_{n+1})
(Xn+1​,Yn+1​) be a new test example. The fundamental assumption in conformal prediction is that the examples are exchangeable.

For a significance level α∈(0,1)\alpha \in (0,1)
α∈(0,1), we seek to construct a prediction set Cα(Xn+1)C_\alpha(X_{n+1})
Cα​(Xn+1​) such that:

P(Yn+1∈Cα(Xn+1))≥1−αP(Y_{n+1} \in C_\alpha(X_{n+1})) \geq 1 - \alphaP(Yn+1​∈Cα​(Xn+1​))≥1−α
2.1.2 Nonconformity Measures
The core concept in conformal prediction is the nonconformity measure, which quantifies how different an example is from the training data. For regression problems, a common choice is:
Ai=∣Yi−f^(Xi)∣A_i = |Y_i - \hat{f}(X_i)|Ai​=∣Yi​−f^​(Xi​)∣
where f^\hat{f}
f^​ is a point predictor trained on the data.

2.1.3 Prediction Intervals
Given nonconformity scores A1,A2,…,AnA_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n
A1​,A2​,…,An​ from the training data, the (1−α)(1-\alpha)
(1−α)-quantile is computed as:

qα=Quantile1−α(A1,A2,…,An)q_\alpha = \text{Quantile}_{1-\alpha}(A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n)qα​=Quantile1−α​(A1​,A2​,…,An​)
The prediction interval for a new example Xn+1X_{n+1}
Xn+1​ is then:

Cα(Xn+1)=[f^(Xn+1)−qα,f^(Xn+1)+qα]C_\alpha(X_{n+1}) = [\hat{f}(X_{n+1}) - q_\alpha, \hat{f}(X_{n+1}) + q_\alpha]Cα​(Xn+1​)=[f^​(Xn+1​)−qα​,f^​(Xn+1​)+qα​]
2.2 Time Series Adaptations
2.2.1 Cross-Validation Plus (CV+)
For stationary time series, the CV+ method adapts conformal prediction using time series cross-validation. The algorithm proceeds as follows:

Time Series Split: Use TimeSeriesSplit to create KK
K folds respecting temporal order

Score Computation: For each fold (traink,calk)(train_k, cal_k)
(traink​,calk​):


Train model f^k\hat{f}_k
f^​k​ on trainktrain_k
traink​
Compute nonconformity scores on calkcal_k
calk​: Ai(k)=∣Yi−f^k(Xi)∣A^{(k)}_i = |Y_i - \hat{f}_k(X_i)|
Ai(k)​=∣Yi​−f^​k​(Xi​)∣


Aggregation: Combine scores from all folds: {A(1),A(2),…,A(K)}\{A^{(1)}, A^{(2)}, \ldots, A^{(K)}\}
{A(1),A(2),…,A(K)}
Quantile Computation: Calculate qαq_\alpha
qα​ from aggregated scores


2.2.2 Adaptive Conformal Prediction
For non-stationary time series, we introduce adaptive conformal prediction methods that adjust to changing data characteristics:
Exponential Decay Method:
wi=(1−γ)n−iw_i = (1-\gamma)^{n-i}wi​=(1−γ)n−i
where γ∈(0,1)\gamma \in (0,1)
γ∈(0,1) is the decay parameter, giving more weight to recent observations.

Sliding Window Method:
$$w_i = \begin{cases}
1/W & \text{if } i > n-W \
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$
where WW
W is the window size.

The weighted quantile is computed as:

qα(w)=WeightedQuantile1−α(A1,…,An;w1,…,wn)q_\alpha^{(w)} = \text{WeightedQuantile}_{1-\alpha}(A_1, \ldots, A_n; w_1, \ldots, w_n)qα(w)​=WeightedQuantile1−α​(A1​,…,An​;w1​,…,wn​)
